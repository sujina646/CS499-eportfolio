# Professional Self-Assessment

## Introduction
Building this ePortfolio for CS 499 has been a significant milestone in my journey through the SNHU Computer Science program. The program has pushed me to grow in unexpected ways, and I'm excited to share my development as a software engineer. My passion lies in creating intuitive and impactful software, particularly in the realms of 3D visualization and mobile applications. My goal is to become a full-stack developer specializing in interactive graphics and mobile solutions.

## Key Areas of Growth

### Teamwork and Collaboration
My experience leading a team in CS 250 to build a task manager app was transformative. I learned essential skills in listening, delegation, and project management. Through peer reviews in CS 330 and debugging sessions in CS 360, I developed into a more effective collaborator. These experiences demonstrate my ability to work in diverse team environments and support organizational decision-making.

### Communication
I've grown significantly in my ability to communicate complex technical concepts. Whether explaining my CS 330 kitchen scene to classmates or presenting designs in IT 315, I've learned to break down complex ideas into understandable components. In CS 360, I demonstrated this by iterating on app UI based on user feedback, showing my ability to adapt communication to different audiences.

### Technical Expertise

#### Algorithms and Data Structures
My work in CS 260 with graph problems and CS 330 with rendering optimization has strengthened my problem-solving abilities. I've developed a passion for finding efficient solutions and optimizing code performance, skills that are crucial in modern software development.

#### Software Engineering and Databases
Following the SDLC in CS 250, implementing refactoring in CS 320, and integrating databases in CS 330 and CS 360 have given me comprehensive experience in full-stack development. My CS 360 trip planner project exemplifies my ability to build complete systems from start to finish.

#### Security
CS 405 instilled in me the importance of secure coding practices. I've learned to anticipate potential vulnerabilities and implement proper input validation to protect user data, a crucial skill in today's security-conscious development environment.
