## 3D Kitchen Scene Project Enhancements

### 1. Software Design & Engineering
Enhanced the software architecture using:
- Scene graph implementation for better object organization
- Component-based system for flexible object management
- Resource management system to optimize memory usage

**Code:** [software-design/](/software-design/)

### 2. Algorithms & Data Structures
Improved performance through:
- Tree data structure implementation
- Spatial partitioning with Octree for efficient rendering
- Resource caching system using hash maps

**Code:** [algorithms/](/algorithms/)

### 3. Databases
Added persistence to the application with:
- SQLite database integration
- Normalized database schema design
- Transaction management for data integrity

**Code:** [databases/](/databases/)
