                <h3>My Computer Science Journey</h3>
                <p>I've been in the Computer Science program for 2 years now, and it's been an incredible journey of growth and discovery. When I first started, I was nervous about the technical challenges ahead, but through dedication and hands-on experience, I've built a solid foundation in both theory and practical applications.</p>
                
                <p>This ePortfolio represents the culmination of my academic journey, showcasing my growth as a software developer and my readiness to enter the professional world. Through my coursework and projects, I've developed a comprehensive set of skills that prepare me for a career in software development.</p>
                
                <h3>Key Skills and Knowledge</h3>
                <p>Throughout my program, I've developed several key skills that have transformed my approach to software development:</p>
                
                <h4>Advanced 3D Graphics Programming</h4>
                <p>My 3D Kitchen Scene project was a game-changer. I remember the first time I got a 3D object to render properly - it was like magic! Through trial and error, I mastered OpenGL, learned about scene graphs, and discovered how to optimize performance. The satisfaction of seeing my kitchen come to life on screen was worth every debugging session.</p>
                
                <h4>Mobile Application Development</h4>
                <p>The Mobile Trip Planner project was born from my love of travel and desire to solve a real problem. I learned that creating a great mobile app isn't just about coding - it's about understanding user needs and creating intuitive interfaces. The biggest challenge was implementing offline functionality, but solving that puzzle taught me so much about mobile architecture.</p>
                
                <h4>Software Architecture and Design</h4>
                <p>This was a tough lesson learned through experience. My early projects were messy and hard to maintain. But through the program, I've learned to think about software design holistically, considering maintainability, scalability, and clean code principles. It's amazing how proper architecture can make even complex projects manageable.</p>
                
                <h3>Collaborative Teamwork</h3>
                <p>One of the most valuable skills I've developed is the ability to work effectively in collaborative environments. Through group projects and peer code reviews, I've learned how to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Communicate technical concepts clearly to team members with different backgrounds</li>
                    <li>Use version control systems effectively for collaborative development</li>
                    <li>Give and receive constructive feedback on code and design decisions</li>
                    <li>Adapt to different team dynamics and work styles</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>These experiences have prepared me to contribute effectively to development teams in professional settings, where collaboration is essential for successful projects.</p>
                
                <h3>Data Structures and Algorithms</h3>
                <p>My coursework in data structures and algorithms has given me a strong foundation in computational thinking. I've learned to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Analyze the time and space complexity of algorithms</li>
                    <li>Select appropriate data structures for specific problems</li>
                    <li>Optimize code for performance and efficiency</li>
                    <li>Implement complex algorithms like spatial partitioning and path finding</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>These skills are demonstrated in my 3D Kitchen Scene enhancement, where I replaced simple data structures with more sophisticated ones to improve performance and scalability.</p>
                
                <h3>Database Design and Management</h3>
                <p>Through my database courses, I've developed a solid understanding of:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Relational database design and normalization</li>
                    <li>SQL query optimization</li>
                    <li>Transaction management and data integrity</li>
                    <li>Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) techniques</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>My database enhancement to the 3D Kitchen Scene project showcases these skills by implementing a robust persistence layer that allows users to save and load their designs.</p>
                
                <h3>Security Mindset</h3>
                <p>Throughout my coursework, I've developed a security-first mindset that helps me anticipate potential vulnerabilities in software design. I've learned to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Implement proper input validation to prevent injection attacks</li>
                    <li>Use prepared statements for database queries</li>
                    <li>Handle errors securely without exposing sensitive information</li>
                    <li>Consider security implications of design decisions</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>This security mindset is reflected in my database enhancement, where I've implemented proper error handling and transaction management to ensure data integrity.</p>
                
                <h3>Professional Growth and Career Goals</h3>
                <p>As I complete my computer science program, I'm excited to apply my skills in a professional setting. My career goals include:</p>
